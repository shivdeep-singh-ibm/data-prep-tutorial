The quality of the model is heavily influenced by the quality and relevance of the training data.</p> <p>This tutorial aims to guide the participants through the essential techniques for preparing data for LLM applications, focusing on the latest methodologies. We will begin by exploring state-of-the-art methods used in the field. Following this, we will provide a hands-on tutorial using data-prep-kit, an open-source toolkit designed to facilitate various data preparation tasks.</p> <p>To ensure the participants gain practical experience, we will construct a comprehensive data processing pipeline tailored to a specific use case in LLM application</p> <p>development. This end-to-end example will equip the participants with the skills and knowledge needed to apply these techniques to their own projects.</p> <p>By the end of this tutorial, the participants will have a solid understanding of data preparation best practices for LLMs and be able to implement them effectively in their applications.</p>"},{"location":"cods-comad-2024/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>This tutorial is organized into three primary sections. The first section will cover the motivation behind data preparation for LLMs and discuss current state-of-the-art techniques. In the second section, we will use a real-life use case to demonstrate how to construct a data preparation pipeline. The third section will introduce a novel development toolkit that allows users to easily add their own transformations and scale up their projects. We will conclude the session with a brainstorming session focused on actionable steps for the community to collaborate and advance research in data preparation for LLMs.</p> <ol> <li>[10 min] Introduction</li> <li>[10 min] Setup for hands-on session</li> <li>[45 min] Part 1: Discussion on techniques for data preparation for Code</li> <li>[60 min] Part 2: Hands-on session to build data pipelines</li> <li>[30 min] Part 3: Bring your own transform</li> <li>[10 min] Conclusion</li> <li>[15 min] Discussion, Q&amp;A and brainstorming on what the community can do to advance this area</li> </ol>"},{"location":"cods-comad-2024/#expected-background","title":"Expected Background","text":"<ol> <li>Basic Knowledge of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL)</li> <li>Basic Understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs)</li> <li>Experience with Programming</li> <li>Familiarity with Data Handling and Preprocessing</li> <li>Basic Understanding of Command Line Interface (CLI)</li> <li>Knowledge of Version Control Systems</li> <li>Basic Understanding of Linux/Unix Systems</li> </ol>"},{"location":"cods-comad-2024/#expected-gained-skills","title":"Expected Gained Skills","text":"<ol> <li>Data Preparation Techniques for LLMs</li> <li>Usage of Open-Source data-prep-kit toolkit</li> <li>Data Processing Pipeline Construction</li> <li>Hands-On Experience with Real-World Use Cases</li> <li>Better Understanding of Data Quality Impact</li> </ol>"},{"location":"cods-comad-2024/#presenters","title":"Presenters","text":"Hima Patel <p>Hima Patel holds dual titles of a Senior Technical Staff Member and Research Manager at IBM Research in Bengaluru, India.
